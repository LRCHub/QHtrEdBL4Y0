I gotta thank a small town preacher
Makin' me a hymn singer
On the Sunday's mamma made me go
I gotta thank a high school teacher
For believin' in a dreamer
And steering me down the road
I gotta thank my granddad for
The Saturday's on the lake
Cookin' 'em and reelin' 'em in
I gotta thank the boys I raised
All kind of hell with
Couldn't ask for better best friends
I gotta thank Earnhardt
Springsteen, Luke Skywalker
For filling up my memory bank
I gotta thank JD, Jim Beam, mr anheuser
For a Friday night good time drink
I gotta thank mama and my daddy
For eighteen years then gasin'
Up the Chevrolet tank no matter who you are
Everybody's got somebody to thank
I gotta thank an old coon dog
For licking my hand on days
I was feeling alone
I gotta thank my old man's brother
For a tour in the jungle
Just to keep us all safe at home
I gotta thank a next door neighbor
For calling that number
That morning our house caught fire
I gotta thank a Midwest farmer
For a teenage summer
With a boy he didn't have to hire
I gotta thank Beau, Luke, Mellencamp
Joe Montana for filling up my memory bank
I gotta thank JD, Jim Beam, mr Anheuser
For a Friday night good time drink
I gotta thank mama and my daddy
For eighteen years then gasin'
Up the Chevrolet tank no matter who you are
Everybody's got somebody to thank
No I ain't forgot and I'll never forget
I gotta thank God for every day I've had
And every day I'll get
I gotta thank the love of my life
Every day and night
For filling up my memory bank
I gotta thank JD, Jim Beam, mr Anheuser
For a Friday night good time drink
I gotta thank mama and my daddy
For eighteen years then gasin'
Up the Chevrolet tank no matter who you are
Everybody's got somebody to thank
